Method:

Challenge 1: Due by Saturday 2/09/2018

Write code for a remote controlled rover: Motor control, forward and reverse, turn, pivot, add remote control

Test -> Devise tests based on breadboard and LEDs

Progress:
* vrover1 - Demonstrate Motor control - DONE - 26/08/2018
* vrover2 - Demonstrate FWD and REV - DONE - 26/08/2018
* vrover3 - Demonstrate Turn - DONE - 1/09/2018
* vrover4 - Demonstrate Pivot - DONE - 1/09/2018
* vrover5 - Demonstrate Remote Control - DONE - 2/09/2018

Challenge 2: Due by Sunday 9/09/2018

* vrover6 - Measure distance based on HC-SRO4 input
* vrover7 - Direct vehicle based on single sensor input (Vehicle uses auto correct based on single sensor input)
* vrover6 - Add multiple sensors
* vrove7 - Direct vehicle based on multi-sensor input (Vehicle uses auto correct based on multi sensor input)

Test -> Use HC-SR04 input mounted on breadboard to light up LEDs

Challenge 3: Due by Sunday 16/09/2018

Define requirements and add code for autonomous vehicle AI

Test -> Requires vehicle prototype for AI training - test in Sydney at group meet up on 20th/21st Sept
