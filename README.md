* vrover2 - Demonstrate FWD and REV - DONE - 26/06/2018
* vrover3 - Demonstrate Turn -  -
* vrover4 - Demonstrate Pivot -  -
* vrover5 - Demonstrate Remote Control -  -

Challenge 2: Due by Sunday 9/09/2018

Write code for movement based on sensor input, 

Test -> Requires testing with input (analogous to Sonar). Use breadboard and sensor (TBC)

Challenge 3: Due by Sunday 16/09/2018
